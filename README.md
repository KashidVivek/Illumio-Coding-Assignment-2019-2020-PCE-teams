##Code Logic
I used C++ programming language to implement this Firewall program. I created a struct of Firewall Rules and stored them into a vector. Further, the function accept_packet checks the input packet with vector elements. 

##Refinements
The code runs in linear time and can be improved by using hashing functions or using unordered_map. 

##Testing
I used the general test cases provided in the assignment to test the code.
